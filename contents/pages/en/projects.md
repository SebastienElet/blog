## Projects

I'm involved in a lot of different projects from add-ons to games, It's a good
 way to stay informed on new development features and improve my skills.

### NodeJS

As as early NodeJS user, i made several modules i
 [published on NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/~nfroidure "View my NPM profile").

In particular, i like make JavaScript parsers (CSV, VarStream, SVG...), stream
 utilities, Gulp plugins and Express/Connect middlewares.

### Firefox / Chrome / Opera add-ons

On my freetime i like to experiment add-ons coding on modern browsers. It's
 an occasion to free myself of the odd Internet Explorer compatibility issues
 ;). You probably already eard about some of those add-ons:
 [KGen](http://kgen.elitwork.com/),
 [BBComposer](http://bbcomposer.elitwork.com/),
 [BugMeBack](https://github.com/nfroidure/BugMeBack)
 and [CanImage](http://canimage.elitwork.com/).

Browser related works are published under GNU/GPL licence.

### HTML5 games

I also build HTML5 games for fun and skills, like :
* [Sumuraÿ](http://sumuray.insertafter.com/)
* [Memory](http://memory.insertafter.com/)
* [Break'It](http://breakit.insertafter.com/)
* [Tank Arena](http://tank.elitwork.com/) (work in progress).
