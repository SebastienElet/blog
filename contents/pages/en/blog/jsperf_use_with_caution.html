<p>JSPerf gives us a simple way to write JavaScript performance tests. Unfortunately,
  tests found aren't always well designed. Here's how to detect and avoid them.</p>

<p>When i discovered <a>itle=Create Performance tests href=http://jsperf.com/]JSperf.com</a>,
  i was realy impressed by its ease of use. Writing JavaScript performance tests
  just became as simple as writing JavaScript :). Knowing it, i'm often looking for
  perf tests on it to quickly have an overview of results for a particular case.</p>
<p>Sadly, it rarely fit my needs, whislt it often reflect a poor understanding of what
  performance testing means. Here is a summary of my experience with those tests,
  how to detect them and how to impeach them to lead developpers to mistakes.</p>
<h3>When tests smell</h3>
<p>One particular case you should be aware of is the use of console.* methods. Thoses
  methods should never be found in a test since <a>itle=Look at a test on console.log speed href=http://jsperf.com/console-log-performance/6]they are really slow</a>  and will tend to equalize test results especially for critical performance test.
  Unfortunately, it's very common to see <a>ref=https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Ajsperf.com++%22console.log(%22&aq=f&oq=site%3Ajsperf.com++%22console.log(%22]tests using console.log</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, If you test something, test it <strong>only</strong>. The above console.log
  test's <a>itle=View one of them href=http://jsperf.com/console-log-performance/2]prior versions</a>  were completely unusefull since they didn't test only console.log. The purpose
  of a test is to reveal the overhead of the tested feature, so you should find the
  smallest footprint possible for your wrapping code.</p>
<p>Another problem with previous revisions of this test is usage of a for loop in order
  to make the test more "massive": JSPerf do it for you, stop wasting your time.</p>
<p>Another common issue is when code is valid, but not well formed. It often lead to
  strange test results. So, take time to read the test code if you plan to exploit
  it's results. Common mistakes of that kind are :</p>
<ul>
  <li>forgetting to execute a function (<code>myFunction;</code> instead of <code>myFunction();</code>),</li>
  <li>abnormal return or break instruction,</li>
  <li>bad logic,</li>
  <li>undefined identifiers,</li>
  <li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Those mistakes are leading most of the time to better performances since some parts
  of the code aren't executed.</p>
<p>Another way to detect bad tests is to look at later revisions, it sometimes add some
  tests but often fix them. All in all, if you do not want to spend time checking
  if a test is right, you can look after JavaScript Rockstars tests (<a>itle=View Addy Osmani tests href=http://jsperf.com/browse/addy-osmani]Addy Osmani</a>,
  <a>itle=View John Resig tests href=http://jsperf.com/browse/john-resig]John Resig</a>,
  ...).</p>
<h3>Avoid creating bad test</h3>
<p>Anyone can create a bad test, but there are some good practices to reduce the risk :</p>
<ul>
  <li>if you're a noob : <strong>don't write tests,</strong>
  </li>
  <li>read your code many times before submitting,</li>
  <li>test your code in the JavaScript console first,</li>
  <li>if you made shit, mark it as shit (comment with a link to the modified revisions),</li>
  <li>if someone mark it as shit, don't be hurt. Testing is not about you, <strong>it's about truth</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it, this post is over. If you've got some other good practices or another
  way to detect bad tests let me know!</p>
