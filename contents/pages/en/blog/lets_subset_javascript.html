<h2>Let's subset JavaScript</h2>
<p>
 TL;DR: Subsetting JavaScript is easy, you can do it with
 <a href="https://github.com/SimpliField/jsub"><code>jsub</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
  At <a href="http://www.simplifield.com">SimpliField</a>, we allow users to collect
  and ananlyse field data and as part of it, our users can create their own
  data models.
</p>
<p>
  As a consequence, we were in need of a solution allowing to define
  dynamically computed relationnal constraints. Things like dynamically define
  a form field as optional based on some conditions/computations.
</p>
<p>
  We ended up with a reliable solution based on a user interface and simple
  conditions. The problem we faced was that every new feature were resulting in
  new complexity.
</p>
<p>
  Also we were defining a new language our API consumers would certainly hate
  once our public API would be available. And friends don't let friends
  struggling with bad APIs ;).
</p>
<h3>A few words about our stack</h3>
<p>
  We're using a full JavaScript stack (we're calling it MEANI for Mongo Express
  Angular NodeJS and Ionic). The big win of this kind of stack is not only
  isomorphism (i had great moments building an
  <a href="http://slides.com/nfroidure/reaccess">end to end user access
  management</a> for our apps).
</p>
<p>
  It is mainly skill reuse. As a JavaScript developper, i can make some changes
  to the back-end and than apply the resulting changes either in the front-end
  and the mobile app. It is really valuable as you don't have to rely on
  someone else to make a bunch of related changes.
</p>
<h3>Subsetting JavaScript</h3>

</p>
<p>
  So we choose to rely on JavaScript for conditionnally displayed fields,
  computed fields etc... The idea is simple: we need a formula language like
  those you can find in Open Office Cacl or Microsoft Excel but we don't want to
  reinvent the wheel.
</p>
<p>
  We also want to have the minimal learning curve for developpers that will
  interact with our API. Since JavaScript was already a first class citizen in
  our stack, subsetting its syntax was in evidence.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to the great <a href="http://esprima.org">Esprima project</a>, a few
  hours only were sufficient to have a first prototype of
  <a href="https://github.com/SimpliField/jsub">jsub</a>; a tiny project aimed
  to simply define a custom JavaScript subset.
</p>
<p>
  You basically define a set of conditions that shapes syntaxically allowed
  expressions. Then, you check script against thos conditions and get errors
  if some in output.
</p>
<pre>
var simpleMath = {
  conditions: [{
    type: 'Program' // allow the root node
  }, {
    type: 'ExpressionStatement' // allow expressions
  }, {
    type: 'BinaryExpression', // allow the + and - operators
    operator: ['+', '-']
  }, {
    type: 'Literal',
    raw: /^([0-9]{1,5})$/ // allow positive numbers
  }]
};

var errors = jsub('(1 + 2) - 1', simpleMath);
assert.equal(errors.length, 0);
</pre>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p>
  Having a custom syntax subsetting JavaScript provides a lot of out of the box
  advantages:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Syntax highlighting: you can simply add highlighted syntax to your own
    API docs</li>
  <li>Hinting: what about a custom JSLint module to help your customers?</li>
  <li>Parsing: syntax errors will be the same than for JavaScript;</li>
  <li>No overhead: Just run it, especially if you are using the MEANI stack ;).</li>
</ul>
<p>
  There's probably a lot more things interesting with this approach let me
  know your thoughts.
