## About

I'm a curious web developper in love with JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, REST and
 Node.js. I'm a hard worker, a bit direct but skillfull. Rigorous but generous.
 I like to invent and share.

I'm mainly blogging about web technologies, historically in French, but I try
 to translate the most interesting posts into English. Feel free to add your
 comments or to contact me if you want to give me your point of view or ask some
 explanations about the content I share here.

I wish you'll find this blog useful and hope to see you soon!
